sort1 uses: Bubble Sort.

How do you know?: Because: 1. At large (n) there is a big difference in time between the worst case and best case scenarios.
                           2. In Worst case scenario the time increases by increasing (n), yet in the Best case scenario the
                              increase in time is much larger than that of the worst case scenario when increasing (n) due to
                              O(n^2) and Omega(n).

sort2 uses: Merge Sort.

How do you know?: Because: 1. Time elapsed for best case and worst case scenarios are similar.
                           2. It has the lowest Average time between all of the three sort files.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort.

How do you know?: Because: 1. Time elapsed for best case and worst case scenarios are similar.
                           2. Yet it has more running time than that of (sort2) file.
